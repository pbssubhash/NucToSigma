description: 'Unauthenticated cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in BeyondTrust
  Secure Remote Access Base Software through 6.0.1 allow remote attackers to inject
  arbitrary web script or HTML. Remote attackers could acheive full admin access to
  the appliance, by tricking the administrator into creating a new admin account through
  an XSS/CSRF attack involving a crafted request to the /appliance/users?action=edit
  endpoint.
