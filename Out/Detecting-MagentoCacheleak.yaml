description: Magento Cacheleak is an implementation vulnerability, result of bad implementation
  of web-server configuration for Magento platform. Magento was developed to work
  under the Apache web-server which natively works with .htaccess files, so all needed
  configuration directives specific for various internal Magento folders were placed
  in .htaccess files.  When Magento is installed on web servers that are ignoring
  .htaccess files (such as nginx), an attacker can get access to internal Magento
  folders (such as the Magento cache directory) and extract sensitive information
  from cache files.
