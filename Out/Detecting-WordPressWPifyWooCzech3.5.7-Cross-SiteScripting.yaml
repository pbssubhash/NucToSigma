description: WordPress WPify Woo Czech plugin before 3.5.7 contains a cross-site scripting
  vulnerability. The plugin uses the Vies library 2.2.0, which has a sample file outputting
  $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] in an attribute without being escaped first. The issue is only
  exploitable when the web server has the PDO driver installed and write access to
  the example directory.
